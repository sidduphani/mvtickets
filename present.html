    <center><h1>IMAX INFORMATION</h1></center>

<h1>Screen sizes<br>
    IMAX theatres have a dome circular and huge plain screens that almost cover the entire theatre and makes you feel like a part of the film. Whereas normal theatres have plain and regular screen of limited pixel resolution. The screen size difference is so much that IMAX screens are six times larger than regular theatre screens.</h1>
<p>Film Formats<br>
    Regular film formats are either 35 mm or 70 mm. Whereas IMAX film formats are 15/70 mm. This means that each frame is 70 mm high and 15 perforations wide. This also means that the film size is about 10 times bigger than the standard 35 mm film, giving the visuals in incredible clarity.
    
     </p>
     <H2>Sound<br>
        IMAX has a patented fully immersive 12.1 channel 15,000-watt digital speaker with a wider frequency response. There are special sound engineers or audio engineers who specialise in creating speakers with a more powerful output in addition to crystal quality sound. The theatre geometry adds to the experience and the sound travels through the auditorium making the movie an enriching experience.
        
         </H2>
         <H3>Projection Technique<br>
            Most IMAX movie theatres use a high-powered laser light engine. Unlike the traditional xenon lamps, IMAX lasers have a twin 4K proprietary digital projectors to light the huge screen, thereby giving the sharpest, brightest, clearest and the most vivid screen images ever.
            
             </H3>
             <S class="CENTER">Aesthetics<BR>
                Legendary IMAX director MacGillivray Freeman claims that the audience experience created in terms of imagery in an IMAX is far detailed than a regular format. The shots in regular films don’t last long because the director controls what the audience looks at. In these cases, the audience is directed to look at a specific thing whereas in IMAX the shot is too descriptive and is naturally longer.</S>
            <h3>HEART-POUNDING AUDIO<br>





                An immense explosion. A whisper heard over your shoulder. The rumbling bass you feel instead of hear. The combination of our perfectly tuned integrated sound system and our precise speaker orientation ensures you can hear a pin drop and be able to tell exactly where it landed. Every note of the soundtrack and every scuff of a shoe is clearer in IMAX, with a complete overhaul of each movie’s audio overseen by the film’s director. All of this pristine sound is then pumped into a theatre that has been customized for an optimal experience.
